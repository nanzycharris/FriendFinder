# FriendFinder
Friend Finder app using Node and Express

The "FriendFinder" application works, basically, as a dating app. This full-stack site takes in results from the users' surveys.
Then compare their answers with those from other users. 
After the survey completion, the app displays the name and picture of the member who best matches your responses.

"Friend Finder" uses Express to handle routing. 
This app has been deployed to Heroku so other users can fill it out and their answers can be recorded accordingly.
